# little-os

#### A small OS written to learn about OS development, following [littleosbook.github.io](http://littleosbook.github.io/ "The little book on OS development") (and my tweaks).

###### Requirements
- A Linux system (I used Ubuntu 14.04)
- A C++ compiler (I used GCC)
- A build system (I used GNU Make)
- (On Ubuntu) the following packages: build-essential, nasm, genisoimage, bochs, bochs-sdl

###### Running
If you're awesome and use Make, just hit `make run` after installing the dependencies. Bochs should start up and start emulating the OS.
